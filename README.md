# Visual Regression Testing with Selenium

Multiplatform testing for visual differences with Selenium Server.

We use node.js in and out so this our tool of choice for testing purposes as well. Make sure we're on the same train by comparing node versions. We work with:
> node v0.12.7
> npm v2.11.3

For easy version switch install nvm:
